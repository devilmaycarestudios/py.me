 I am an API and Selenium automation assessment project written in Python3

#### Prerequisites:
 - Python3 installed on OS - [Installation guide here](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
 - Firefox is the default test browser if settings file is not updated with the user's preferred browser

#### Usage:
- run ```python get-pip.py``` if `pip` is not already installed
- run ```pip install pytest``` 
- In the PyCharm terminal or native OS terminal/command line run ```pytest --html=report.html``` from within the `tests` folder in the project
